### Original repository (with the author's solution):

https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks


## How to use:

My solutions are (by now) inside the SalesAnalysis folder, in the file Solution.ipynb.

To access it, its recommended to have jupyter notebook installed and the repository cloned on your device.

## The questions were:

### First:

 * Gather all data inside SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data in one .csv file named "All_Months.csv".

### Second:
 
 * Based on the data gathered in "All_Months.csv" find what was the month with the greates total of money received by sales.
